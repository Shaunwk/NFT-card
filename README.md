It was a fun project and I look forward to doing many more to get better. 

The things I learned in this challenge was the :hover CSS psuedo-class. 
It was easy to implement over text but it took me a while to figure out how to do it over a image and have a icon inside it.
The thing I kept getting wrong was the background color when lessening the opacity it caused the icon to also lessen opacity.
To fix this I used hsla on the background color so I can set the opacity on the color itself and the icon was able to stay at 100% opacity. 

Another thing I realized i didn't know when doing this challenge was how to make a line to seperate sections. 
It was easy to figure out with some CSS so glad to have that stored in my mind now.
